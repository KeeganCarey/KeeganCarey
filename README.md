### 🏆 Hackathons & Experience (with my Teammate @chimbiwide)

**Google Tunix Hack | Machine Learning Researcher** 
* Engineered a custom data pipeline to synthetically generate tens of thousands of reasoning traces for a high-fidelity Chain-of-Thought (CoT) dataset.
* Post-trained a 1B-parameter Gemma 3 model on TPU infrastructure utilizing SFT and a novel GRPO strategy.
* Test piloted Google's new Tunix training library, documenting the fine-tuning strategy in a notebook shortlisted as a "high quality submission".

**Google Gemma3n Impact Challenge | AI Developer** ]
* Fine-tuned a SOTA Gemma 3n mobile model for NPC gaming interaction using Unsloth and LoRA adapters.
* Quantized models to 4-bit and 8-bit GGUF formats via Llama.cpp to halve memory footprint and enable faster local inference.
* Built 3 interactive game demos (including a voice-controlled chatbot), driving over 2,600 model downloads on Hugging Face.

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

* **Real Time Conversational AI Pipeline (Python):** Engineered an end-to-end voice pipeline using up to 5 distinct AI models to converse with a 3D game avatar. Achieved 1.2s average response times via multithreading for STT and LLM token generation. Fully controllable via a custom Discord bot.
* **ASCII Voxel Game Renderer (Java):** Built a custom 3D Voxel game renderer without external libraries that renders frames using ASCII characters in the console. Optimized performance using back face culling and LOD techniques.
